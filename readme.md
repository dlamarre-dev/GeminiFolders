## ✨ Features

### 📁 Folder Manager

* 📱 **Mobile Sync (Bookmarks Bridge):** Access your conversations on the go! Toggle the mobile sync to create a smart, one-way synced folder in your browser's bookmarks. It perfectly mirrors your extension's layout and **your custom sort order** right on your phone.
* ⚡ **Quick Save (Context Menu & Shortcuts):** Save the current conversation directly to any folder using the right-click menu, or use the global keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+S` or `Alt+Shift+S` on Firefox) to instantly send it to a "⚡ Quick Saves" folder. Includes smart visual alerts (toasts) to let you know if a conversation is already saved!
* 🛡️ **Bulletproof Database & Smart Deduplication:** Your database is shielded against corruption with a secure fallback architecture. Plus, our smart URL normalization ensures you never get false duplicates even if Gemini changes its URL parameters.
* ☑️ **Bulk Actions (Multi-Select):** Select multiple conversations at once using checkboxes to move or delete them in batches, saving you tons of clicks.
* 📑 **Tab Groups Integration:** Open an entire folder of conversations with a single click. They will automatically open in native, color-coded browser Tab Groups (where supported) for ultimate project management.
* 😃 **Custom Folder Emojis:** Start your folder name with an emoji (e.g., "💻 Code" or "🌍 Travel") and the extension will automatically use it as the folder's icon instead of the default one.
* ⇅ **Custom Sorting:** Sort your folders and saved conversations on the fly by Newest, Oldest, or Alphabetically (A-Z) using the dedicated dropdown menu, **with changes reflecting instantly in your mobile sync**.
* 🖱️ **Drag & Drop:** Easily move saved conversations between folders to reorganize your workspace intuitively.
* 🗜️ **Ultra-Efficient Compression:** Automatically compresses your synced data using LZString, maximizing your browser's native storage capacity so you can save hundreds of conversations securely.
* 📊 **Storage Tracker:** A sleek visual progress bar keeps you informed of your available cloud storage capacity in real-time, complete with detailed tooltips.
* 🎨 **Modern Material UI:** Enjoy a fully seamless experience with custom Material 3 modal dialogs (no more native browser popups!), a sleek ultra-compact footer, a collapsible "Add" panel, and clean hover effects.
* 📁 **Smart Folders:** Group your chats by projects, themes, or categories. Create empty folders in advance and manage them easily.
* 📌 **Pin Favorites:** Pin your most important folders to the top of the list for ultra-fast access.
* 🤖 **Smart Title Detection:** No more typing! The extension automatically reads the Gemini interface to extract the exact name of your current conversation in the background.
* 🔍 **Instant Search:** Find any conversation quickly with a real-time search bar.
* ☁️ **Cloud Sync:** Uses native `storage.sync` to keep your folders synchronized across all devices connected to your browser profile.
* 💾 **Import / Export:** Easily backup and restore your folder structure (including pinned folders) via JSON files.
* 🌍 **Multilingual & Adaptive:** Automatically detects your browser language (now supporting **16 languages** worldwide!) and matches your system's Dark/Light mode.
* 🤝 **Open Source & Modular:** Fully transparent, refactored code with a clean, modular architecture (separated UI, data logic, and styling) making it easier than ever for the community to contribute. A dynamic GitHub version link is integrated right into the extension's footer.

### 📝 Prompt Manager

* 📝 **Prompt Library:** Switch to Prompt Mode using the pill toggle in the header. Save any reusable prompt with a title and full text, then find it instantly with search and sort (newest, oldest, A-Z).
* ▶ **One-Click Injection:** Hit the play button on any saved prompt to inject it directly into the active Gemini tab's input field—no copy-pasting required. The extension detects whether you're on Gemini and notifies you if not.
* ✏️ **Inline Editing:** Click a prompt to expand it and edit the text directly. Changes auto-save after a short pause and the sort order updates to reflect the latest modification.
* 💎 **Custom Gem Link:** Configure a custom Gemini Gem URL and toggle it on/off with the 💎 button. When active, the "New Conversation" button opens your Gem instead of the default chat.
* ☁️ **Prompt Sync:** Enable cloud sync for your prompt library independently from your folders, keeping your prompts available across all your devices.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

This extension is built with privacy in mind. 
* It **only** requests access to the `gemini.google.com` domain and the context menu.
* It requires the `bookmarks` permission strictly to create and manage the "Gemini Folders (Sync)" folder if you enable the Mobile Sync feature.
* It dynamically reads the active tab's content **only** when you explicitly save a conversation to generate a title.
* All data is stored using your browser's built-in sync storage. **No third-party servers** or tracking tools are used, and your data remains entirely yours.

## 💻 Built With

* HTML5 / CSS3 (Separated Stylesheets)
* Vanilla JavaScript (Modular Architecture: UI, Logic, Bulk Actions)
* WebExtensions API (Manifest V3)
